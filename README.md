An app made with my other project's encryption and decryption functions that makes and stores encrypted notes.
- pyw = python script without the command prompt
- Cryptography libraries = needed libraries for the app to work

I saved the libraries needed for this app so if something happens, my project will still work in the future

Needed Libraries as of v0.8 are:
  1. AES-Encryptor
  2. pyperclip
  3. pycryptodome

Current state of the app (v0.9):

PS. The notes you open should be in the same folder as the executable and the notes you create will be created in the folder in which the executable is located.
