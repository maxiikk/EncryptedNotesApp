An app made with my other project's encryption and decryption functions that makes and stores encrypted notes.
- pyw = python script without the command prompt
- Cryptography libraries = needed libraries for the app to work

I saved the libraries needed for this app so if something happens, my project will still work in the future

Needed Libraries as of v1.5 are:
  1. AES-Encryptor
  2. pyperclip
  3. pycryptodome

Current state of the app (v1.5):

PS. The notes you open should be in the same folder as the executable and the notes you create will be created in the folder in which the executable is located. Or you can open the notes through the file selection dialog
